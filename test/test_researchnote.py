Fitting SDSS spectra
====================

:date: 2012/10/30

:tags: SDSS, fit

Spectra can be fetched from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database using
the ``sloany`` command line utility. This programs takes an SQL query as input
and sends this query to the database server. If the ``-f`` flag is passed, the
spectra are fetched from the database. The directory ``~/SDSS`` contains 10501
raw spectra. These spectra are contained in FITS files whose format is
described on the SDSS website. The files are named
``spec-PPPP-MMMMM-FFFF.fits`` where PPPP corresponds to the plate number, MMMMM
is the MJD date and FFFF is the fiber id.

Problem with SDSS J1406-0119
============================

:date: 2012/10/28

There seems to be a problem with the object SDSS J1406-0119. There are two
long names that correspond to this short name::


    J1406-0119   J1406-0119   22.22   sdss/J140619.82-011933.1   3   sdss/J140619.82-011933.1   3
    J1406-0119   J1406-0119   22.22   sdss/J140619.96-011932.4   3   sdss/J140619.96-011932.4   3

Indeed, a simple search in the ``METADATA`` files (``~/SDSS/*/METADATA``) finds
the following to spectra::

    spec-0915-52443-0607.fits    J140619.96-011932.4    J1406-0119
    spec-4038-55363-0792.fits    J140619.82-011933.1    J1406-0119

It turns out this is a single object. This object has been measured by both the
BOSS spectrometer and the SDSS (SEGUE 1 or 2) spectrometer.
